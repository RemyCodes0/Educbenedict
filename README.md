# üéì EducBenedict

EducBenedict is a web application designed to help students, especially in Cameroon, practice past GCE (General Certificate of Education) questions. This project was initially developed during my time at Saint Benedict Catholic High School and primarily focuses on backend functionalities. The application allows students to answer questions from GCE Paper 1, Paper 2, and Paper 3:

- **Paper 1**: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that students can answer and immediately receive their score out of 50.
- **Paper 2**: Structural questions, featuring an AI that attempts to answer each question.
- **Paper 3**: Further practice sections, details to be expanded.

The application is live and functioning, though the **frontend still needs a lot of refinement**. I developed this project to demonstrate my backend development skills and to support Cameroonian students in their preparation for GCE Advanced Level.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
